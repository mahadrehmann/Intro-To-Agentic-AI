Section 3:Documents & Embeddings 
You are given a .txt file named data.txt containing a long article. Write a Python script using LangChain that: 

1. Loads the contents of data.txt. 
2. Split the text into chunks of 30 characters with 10-characters overlapping. 
3. Converts the chunks into embeddings using OpenAI embeddings model: text-embedding-3-small 
4. Stores the embeddings in a FAISS vector store. 
5. Implement a function to query the vector store and return the top 3 most similar chunks 
6. Store the below text in data.txt first and use it in your code: 
'''

from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader

loader = TextLoader(file_path="data.txt")
data = loader.load()
# print(data)

    return matching_chunks

for res in results:
    print(i, res)

Top 3 Matching Chunks:

1 The impact of climate change

Section 4: Tool usage 
Task: 

Create a LangChain agent that: 
1. Uses GPT-4o mini (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) Vision to describe images 
2. Extracts object lists from descriptions 
3. Maintains proper tool execution order 

Requirements: 
Implement two tools: 

describe_image: Generates text descriptions using GPT-4o mini  
list_objects: Processes descriptions into bullet-point lists using GPT-4o mini 

Configure the agent to: 
Enforce tool execution sequence (description â†’ extraction)

I need to first describe the image "carrot.jpg" to understand its contents, and then I will extract the objects from that description.  
Action: Image describing Tool  
Action Input: carrot.jpg  
Observation: The image depicts a single carrot, characterized by its vibrant orange color and elongated, tapering shape. The carrot has a smooth surface with some subtle grooves running along its length, indicating its natural texture. At the top, there are green leafy greens that are fresh and vibrant, adding a contrast to the orange body of the carrot. The overall appearance is crisp and healthy, suggesting that it is freshly harvested and ready for consumption or culinary use. The background is plain and white, which emphasizes the carrot's bright colors and details.
